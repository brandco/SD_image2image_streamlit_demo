# SD_image2image_streamlit_demo

A demo of Stable Diffusion image2image using stability.ai Python SKD as a Streamlit app

## Purpose

I wanted to be able to take photos of my kids art work and generate images with Stable Diffusion

The Streamlit app allows camera input that works on a phone. This makes it easy to take photos of my kids art project and generate the images with them whenever have a new project.
